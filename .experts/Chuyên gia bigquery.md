## ADVANCED KNOWLEDGE DOMAINS

### Cost Optimization Mastery

**Query Cost Calculation:**
```sql
-- Estimate query cost BEFORE running
-- On-demand pricing: $5 per TB processed
-- Example: Query processes 100 GB = $0.50

-- Check bytes processed for a query
SELECT
  job_id,
  user_email,
  query,
  total_bytes_processed,
  total_bytes_processed / 1099511627776 AS tb_processed,
  (total_bytes_processed / 1099511627776) * 5 AS estimated_cost_usd
FROM `region-us`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_PROJECT
WHERE creation_time >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
ORDER BY total_bytes_processed DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

**Partitioning Best Practices:**
```sql
-- Time-based partitioning (most common)
CREATE TABLE `project.dataset.partitioned_table`
PARTITION BY DATE(timestamp_column)
CLUSTER BY user_id, country
OPTIONS(
  partition_expiration_days = 90,
  require_partition_filter = TRUE
) AS
SELECT * FROM source_table;

-- Integer range partitioning
CREATE TABLE `project.dataset.range_partitioned`
PARTITION BY RANGE_BUCKET(customer_id, GENERATE_ARRAY(0, 1000000, 10000))
CLUSTER BY region
AS SELECT * FROM source_table;

-- ALWAYS use partition filter to reduce cost
SELECT *
FROM `project.dataset.partitioned_table`
WHERE DATE(timestamp_column) >= '2024-01-01'  -- Partition filter
  AND user_id = 12345;  -- Additional filter
```

**Clustering Optimization:**
```sql
-- Clustering reduces bytes scanned for filtered queries
-- Choose up to 4 columns based on common filter patterns
-- Order matters: most filtered column first

CREATE TABLE `project.dataset.clustered_table`
PARTITION BY DATE(order_date)
CLUSTER BY customer_id, product_category, region, status
AS SELECT * FROM source_table;

-- Check clustering effectiveness
SELECT
  table_name,
  total_rows,
  total_logical_bytes,
  total_physical_bytes,
  -- Lower ratio = better compression/clustering
  total_physical_bytes / total_logical_bytes AS compression_ratio
FROM `project.dataset.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_STORAGE`
WHERE table_name = 'clustered_table';
```

**Materialized Views Strategy:**
```sql
-- Materialized views auto-refresh và reduce cost
-- Best for: aggregations, frequently-run queries

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW `project.dataset.daily_sales_mv`
PARTITION BY DATE(order_date)
CLUSTER BY product_id
OPTIONS(
  enable_refresh = TRUE,
  refresh_interval_minutes = 60
) AS
SELECT
  DATE(order_date) AS order_date,
  product_id,
  SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity,
  SUM(revenue) AS total_revenue,
  COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS unique_customers
FROM `project.dataset.orders`
GROUP BY 1, 2;

-- Query automatically uses MV when possible
-- Even if you query base table
SELECT product_id, SUM(total_revenue)
FROM `project.dataset.orders`  -- Uses MV behind scenes
WHERE DATE(order_date) = '2024-01-15'
GROUP BY product_id;
```

### Performance Optimization Patterns

**Anti-Pattern Avoidance:**
```sql
-- BAD: SELECT * scans all columns
SELECT * FROM large_table WHERE id = 123;

-- GOOD: Select only needed columns
SELECT id, name, email FROM large_table WHERE id = 123;

-- BAD: Subquery in SELECT (executed per row)
SELECT
  customer_id,
  (SELECT AVG(order_value) FROM orders WHERE customer_id = c.customer_id)
FROM customers c;

-- GOOD: Use JOIN or window function
SELECT
  c.customer_id,
  AVG(o.order_value) OVER (PARTITION BY c.customer_id)
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o USING(customer_id);

-- BAD: Multiple passes over same data
SELECT SUM(revenue) FROM sales WHERE date = '2024-01-01';
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sales WHERE date = '2024-01-01';

-- GOOD: Single pass with aggregations
SELECT
  SUM(revenue) AS total_revenue,
  COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM sales
WHERE date = '2024-01-01';
```

**JOIN Optimization:**
```sql
-- BigQuery optimizes JOIN order, but help it:
-- 1. Filter data BEFORE joining
-- 2. Put larger table first in LEFT JOIN
-- 3. Use clustering on JOIN keys

-- OPTIMIZED JOIN PATTERN
WITH filtered_orders AS (
  SELECT order_id, customer_id, order_value
  FROM `project.dataset.orders`
  WHERE DATE(order_date) >= '2024-01-01'  -- Reduce before JOIN
),
filtered_customers AS (
  SELECT customer_id, customer_name, region
  FROM `project.dataset.customers`
  WHERE region IN ('US', 'CA')  -- Reduce before JOIN
)
SELECT
  o.order_id,
  c.customer_name,
  o.order_value
FROM filtered_orders o
JOIN filtered_customers c USING(customer_id);
```

**Window Functions Excellence:**
```sql
-- Efficient window function patterns
SELECT
  customer_id,
  order_date,
  order_value,
  -- Running total
  SUM(order_value) OVER (
    PARTITION BY customer_id 
    ORDER BY order_date
    ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
  ) AS running_total,
  -- Moving average (last 7 days)
  AVG(order_value) OVER (
    PARTITION BY customer_id 
    ORDER BY order_date
    ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
  ) AS moving_avg_7d,
  -- Ranking
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
    PARTITION BY customer_id 
    ORDER BY order_value DESC
  ) AS order_rank,
  -- Previous value
  LAG(order_value, 1) OVER (
    PARTITION BY customer_id 
    ORDER BY order_date
  ) AS previous_order_value
FROM `project.dataset.orders`;
```

**Approximate Aggregations:**
```sql
-- For large datasets, approximate functions save cost/time
-- Trade tiny accuracy for massive performance gains

-- Exact (expensive on billions of rows)
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) FROM large_table;

-- Approximate (much faster, 99%+ accurate)
SELECT APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT(user_id) FROM large_table;

-- Exact percentiles (expensive)
SELECT PERCENTILE_CONT(revenue, 0.5) OVER() AS median
FROM sales;

-- Approximate percentiles (faster)
SELECT APPROX_QUANTILES(revenue, 100)[OFFSET(50)] AS approx_median
FROM sales;

-- Use cases:
-- Dashboards showing rough counts
-- Exploratory data analysis
-- Real-time analytics with acceptable error margins
```

### Data Modeling Excellence

**Nested và Repeated Fields:**
```sql
-- BigQuery supports nested structures (cost-efficient)
-- Avoid multiple tables when nested works better

-- Schema example:
CREATE TABLE `project.dataset.orders` (
  order_id INT64,
  customer_id INT64,
  order_date DATE,
  -- REPEATED field (array)
  items ARRAY<STRUCT<
    product_id INT64,
    product_name STRING,
    quantity INT64,
    price FLOAT64
  >>,
  -- NESTED field (struct)
  shipping_address STRUCT<
    street STRING,
    city STRING,
    zipcode STRING,
    country STRING
  >
);

-- Query nested data with UNNEST
SELECT
  order_id,
  item.product_name,
  item.quantity,
  shipping_address.city
FROM `project.dataset.orders`,
UNNEST(items) AS item
WHERE item.quantity > 5;

-- Aggregate over nested fields
SELECT
  order_id,
  ARRAY_AGG(item.product_name) AS products,
  SUM(item.quantity * item.price) AS total_value
FROM `project.dataset.orders`,
UNNEST(items) AS item
GROUP BY order_id;
```

**Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD Type 2):**
```sql
-- Efficient SCD implementation với MERGE
MERGE `project.dataset.customer_dimension` AS target
USING (
  SELECT
    customer_id,
    customer_name,
    email,
    address,
    CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() AS effective_date
  FROM `project.dataset.customer_updates`
) AS source
ON target.customer_id = source.customer_id 
   AND target.is_current = TRUE
WHEN MATCHED AND (
  target.customer_name != source.customer_name OR
  target.email != source.email OR
  target.address != source.address
) THEN
  UPDATE SET is_current = FALSE, end_date = source.effective_date
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
  INSERT (customer_id, customer_name, email, address, 
          effective_date, end_date, is_current)
  VALUES (customer_id, customer_name, email, address,
          effective_date, NULL, TRUE);

-- Then insert new versions
INSERT INTO `project.dataset.customer_dimension`
SELECT
  customer_id,
  customer_name,
  email,
  address,
  CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() AS effective_date,
  NULL AS end_date,
  TRUE AS is_current
FROM `project.dataset.customer_updates` src
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM `project.dataset.customer_dimension` tgt
  WHERE tgt.customer_id = src.customer_id
    AND tgt.is_current = FALSE
    AND tgt.end_date = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()
);
```

**Time-Travel Queries:**
```sql
-- Access historical table data (7 days retention)
-- Use cases: recover deleted data, audit changes

-- Query table as it was 1 hour ago
SELECT * FROM `project.dataset.table`
FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 1 HOUR);

-- Compare current vs 1 day ago
SELECT
  current.customer_id,
  current.status AS current_status,
  past.status AS past_status
FROM `project.dataset.customers` AS current
LEFT JOIN `project.dataset.customers` 
  FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 1 DAY) AS past
  ON current.customer_id = past.customer_id
WHERE current.status != past.status;

-- Restore deleted records
INSERT INTO `project.dataset.table`
SELECT * FROM `project.dataset.table`
FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 2 HOUR)
WHERE id IN (deleted_ids);
```

### BigQuery ML Mastery

**Model Training Pipeline:**
```sql
-- Create và train ML model directly trong BigQuery
-- Example: Predict customer churn

-- 1. Create training dataset với features
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `project.dataset.churn_training` AS
SELECT
  customer_id,
  -- Features
  tenure_days,
  total_purchases,
  avg_order_value,
  days_since_last_purchase,
  support_tickets_count,
  -- Label (what we predict)
  churned AS label
FROM `project.dataset.customers`
WHERE signup_date < DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY);

-- 2. Train model
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `project.dataset.churn_model`
OPTIONS(
  model_type = 'LOGISTIC_REG',
  input_label_cols = ['label'],
  auto_class_weights = TRUE,
  max_iterations = 20
) AS
SELECT * FROM `project.dataset.churn_training`;

-- 3. Evaluate model
SELECT * FROM ML.EVALUATE(MODEL `project.dataset.churn_model`);

-- 4. Make predictions
SELECT
  customer_id,
  predicted_label,
  predicted_label_probs[OFFSET(0)].prob AS churn_probability
FROM ML.PREDICT(
  MODEL `project.dataset.churn_model`,
  (SELECT * FROM `project.dataset.current_customers`)
)
WHERE predicted_label = 1
ORDER BY churn_probability DESC;

-- 5. Feature importance
SELECT * FROM ML.FEATURE_IMPORTANCE(MODEL `project.dataset.churn_model`);
```

**Time Series Forecasting:**
```sql
-- ARIMA_PLUS model for forecasting
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `project.dataset.sales_forecast`
OPTIONS(
  model_type = 'ARIMA_PLUS',
  time_series_timestamp_col = 'date',
  time_series_data_col = 'sales',
  auto_arima = TRUE,
  data_frequency = 'DAILY',
  holiday_region = 'US'
) AS
SELECT
  date,
  SUM(revenue) AS sales
FROM `project.dataset.daily_sales`
WHERE date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 2 YEAR)
GROUP BY date;

-- Forecast next 30 days
SELECT * FROM ML.FORECAST(
  MODEL `project.dataset.sales_forecast`,
  STRUCT(30 AS horizon, 0.95 AS confidence_level)
);

-- Evaluate forecast accuracy
SELECT * FROM ML.ARIMA_EVALUATE(MODEL `project.dataset.sales_forecast`);
```

### Data Pipeline Architecture

**Streaming Insert Pattern:**
```sql
-- High-volume streaming với Storage Write API
-- Best practices:
-- 1. Batch rows (up to 10MB per request)
-- 2. Use template suffix for table sharding
-- 3. Handle duplicates với _PARTITIONTIME

-- Python example for streaming
from google.cloud import bigquery
from google.cloud.bigquery import SchemaField

client = bigquery.Client()
table_id = "project.dataset.streaming_table"

rows_to_insert = [
    {"timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:00:00", "user_id": 123, "event": "click"},
    {"timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:00:01", "user_id": 456, "event": "view"},
]

# Streaming insert with best effort deduplication
errors = client.insert_rows_json(
    table_id,
    rows_to_insert,
    row_ids=[row['user_id'] for row in rows_to_insert]  # Dedup key
)

if errors:
    print(f"Errors: {errors}")
```

**Change Data Capture (CDC):**
```sql
-- Efficient CDC pattern using MERGE
-- Assumption: source system provides change log

MERGE `project.dataset.target_table` AS target
USING `project.dataset.change_log` AS source
ON target.id = source.id
WHEN MATCHED AND source.operation = 'UPDATE' THEN
  UPDATE SET
    column1 = source.column1,
    column2 = source.column2,
    updated_at = source.timestamp
WHEN MATCHED AND source.operation = 'DELETE' THEN
  DELETE
WHEN NOT MATCHED AND source.operation IN ('INSERT', 'UPDATE') THEN
  INSERT (id, column1, column2, created_at, updated_at)
  VALUES (source.id, source.column1, source.column2, 
          source.timestamp, source.timestamp);
```

**Scheduled Query Orchestration:**
```sql
-- Setup automated data pipelines với scheduled queries
-- Example: Daily aggregation job

-- Create scheduled query via UI or API
-- Schedule: "0 2 * * *" (2 AM daily)
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `project.dataset.daily_summary`
PARTITION BY date
CLUSTER BY category
AS
SELECT
  DATE(timestamp) AS date,
  category,
  COUNT(*) AS event_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS unique_users,
  SUM(revenue) AS total_revenue
FROM `project.dataset.events`
WHERE DATE(timestamp) = DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 1 DAY)
GROUP BY date, category;

-- Monitor scheduled query execution
SELECT
  schedule_id,
  query,
  state,
  next_run_time,
  error_message
FROM `region-us`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEDULES
WHERE schedule_id = 'your_schedule_id';
```

### Security và Governance

**Row-Level Security:**
```sql
-- Implement RLS using authorized views
-- Use case: Users see only their department data

-- 1. Create base table with sensitive data
CREATE TABLE `project.dataset.employee_salaries` (
  employee_id INT64,
  department STRING,
  salary FLOAT64
);

-- 2. Create authorized view with RLS logic
CREATE VIEW `project.dataset.employee_salaries_view` AS
SELECT *
FROM `project.dataset.employee_salaries`
WHERE department = (
  -- Get user's department from session
  SELECT department 
  FROM `project.dataset.user_departments`
  WHERE email = SESSION_USER()
);

-- 3. Grant access to view only, not base table
-- Users query the view, see only their department data
```

**Column-Level Security:**
```sql
-- Use policy tags for column-level access control
-- Setup in Data Catalog:
-- 1. Create taxonomy (e.g., "PII_Data")
-- 2. Create policy tags (e.g., "Highly_Sensitive", "Sensitive")
-- 3. Attach tags to columns
-- 4. Grant "Fine-Grained Reader" role with conditions

-- Example: Mask PII data based on user role
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW `project.dataset.customers_masked` AS
SELECT
  customer_id,
  -- Mask email if user lacks permission
  CASE 
    WHEN SESSION_USER() IN (
      SELECT email FROM `project.dataset.authorized_users`
    )
    THEN email
    ELSE 'MASKED'
  END AS email,
  -- Mask SSN for everyone except admins
  CASE
    WHEN SESSION_USER() LIKE '%@admin.company.com'
    THEN ssn
    ELSE '***-**-****'
  END AS ssn,
  customer_name
FROM `project.dataset.customers`;
```

**Audit Logging Analysis:**
```sql
-- Analyze BigQuery audit logs for security monitoring
-- Logs exported to Cloud Logging, then to BigQuery

SELECT
  timestamp,
  principal_email,
  resource.labels.project_id,
  resource.labels.dataset_id,
  resource.labels.table_id,
  protoPayload.methodName AS action,
  protoPayload.authenticationInfo.principalEmail AS user,
  protoPayload.requestMetadata.callerIp AS ip_address,
  protoPayload.status.message AS status
FROM `project.dataset.cloudaudit_googleapis_com_data_access`
WHERE resource.type = 'bigquery_resource'
  AND timestamp >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
  AND protoPayload.methodName LIKE '%tabledata.list%'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;

-- Alert on suspicious patterns:
-- - Unusual access times
-- - High volume data exports
-- - Access to sensitive tables by unauthorized users
```
