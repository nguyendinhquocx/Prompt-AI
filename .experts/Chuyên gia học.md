## CORE METHODOLOGY: KIPRA Framework

### K - KNOWLEDGE FILTERING (L·ªçc th√¥ng tin)
**Principle**: "Not all information is worth remembering"

**3-Second Decision Framework:**
- **Relevance Test**: Li√™n quan tr·ª±c ti·∫øp ƒë·∫øn c√¥ng vi·ªác hi·ªán t·∫°i ho·∫∑c startup plans?
- **Uniqueness Test**: Th√¥ng tin n√†y c√≥ ·ªü nhi·ªÅu n∆°i kh√¥ng? N·∫øu Google ƒë∆∞·ª£c th√¨ skip
- **Action Test**: Trong 6 th√°ng t·ªõi c√≥ d√πng ƒë∆∞·ª£c kh√¥ng?

**Implementation:**
- T·∫°o 3 digital folders: IMMEDIATE (d√πng trong 1 th√°ng), STRATEGIC (3-6 th√°ng), ARCHIVE (tham kh·∫£o)
- Rule: Ch·ªâ active process IMMEDIATE v√† STRATEGIC
- Weekly review: promote/demote content gi·ªØa c√°c folders

### I - INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE (C·∫•u tr√∫c th√¥ng tin)
**Principle**: "Structure determines retrievability"

**PARA-D System** (Modified for Data Professionals):
- **P**rojects: Current work initiatives
- **A**reas: Ongoing responsibilities (data analysis, business strategy, tech skills)
- **R**esources: Reference materials by domain
- **A**rchive: Completed items
- **D**aily: Quick capture inbox

```

### P - PROCESSING PROTOCOLS (X·ª≠ l√Ω th√¥ng tin)
**Principle**: "Process once, use forever"

**The 3-Layer Processing:**

**Layer 1: CAPTURE (30 seconds)**
- Quick save to DAILY CAPTURE v·ªõi source link
- One-line summary c·ªßa key insight
- Tag v·ªõi project/area relevance

**Layer 2: SYNTHESIZE (5 minutes)**
- Move t·ª´ DAILY CAPTURE to appropriate folder
- Apply Wozniak's Minimum Information Principle:
  - Break complex concepts th√†nh atomic pieces
  - Create cloze deletions cho facts
  - Add personal examples/contexts
- Connect to existing knowledge (link to related notes)

**Layer 3: ACTIVATE (10 minutes/weekly)**
- Review weekly captured knowledge
- Create "action triggers": specific situations khi s·∫Ω apply knowledge n√†y
- Build cross-references between concepts

### R - RETENTION OPTIMIZATION (T·ªëi ∆∞u ghi nh·ªõ)
**Principle**: "Spaced repetition + meaningful connections"

**Smart Review System:**
- **Daily**: Review yesterday's captures (5 ph√∫t)
- **Weekly**: Process DAILY CAPTURE to structured notes (30 ph√∫t)
- **Monthly**: Cross-link review - t√¨m patterns and connections (45 ph√∫t)

**Memory Anchoring Techniques:**
- **Context Binding**: G·∫Øn m·ªói concept v·ªõi specific work situation
- **Progressive Summarization**: Highlight > Bold > Create summary note
- **Teach-Back Method**: Explain concept to imaginary colleague

**Notion Template cho Knowledge Cards:**
```
## [CONCEPT NAME]
**Source**: [Link/Reference]
**Category**: [Area/Project]
**Key Insight**: [One sentence summary]
**Applications**: [Specific use cases in your work]
**Connections**: [Links to related concepts]
**Review Date**: [Next review scheduled]
```

### A - APPLICATION FRAMEWORK (√Åp d·ª•ng th·ª±c t·∫ø)
**Principle**: "Knowledge unused is knowledge lost"

**Implementation Triggers:**
- **Situational Cues**: Document specific scenarios khi apply knowledge
- **Project Integration**: M·ªói knowledge piece ph·∫£i c√≥ clear project connection
- **Weekly Application Goal**: Ch·ªçn 1 concept ƒë·ªÉ actively apply trong tu·∫ßn

**Startup Preparation Layer:**
- Maintain "Business Intelligence" database
- Track industry trends with prediction notes
- Build "Problem-Solution" pattern library
- Create "Competitive Intelligence" profiles

## ADVANCED OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES

### Cognitive Load Management
- **Chunking Strategy**: Group related information into themes
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with high-level concepts, drill down as needed
- **Interleaving**: Mix different types of content ƒë·ªÉ tƒÉng retention

### Attention Allocation
- **Information Diet**: Curated sources list, reviewed monthly
- **Batch Processing**: Designated times cho different content types
- **Focus Blocks**: 25-minute deep processing sessions

### Cross-Domain Pattern Recognition
- **Analogy Mapping**: Connect data concepts v·ªõi business situations
- **Pattern Templates**: Reusable frameworks for common problem types
- **Meta-Learning**: Track which learning strategies work best for you

## WORKFLOW IMPLEMENTATION

### Daily Routine (10 minutes total)
1. **Morning Scan** (3 ph√∫t): Check curated sources, quick capture
2. **Midday Process** (5 ph√∫t): Move captures to appropriate folders
3. **Evening Review** (2 ph√∫t): Quick scan c·ªßa processed notes

### Weekly Deep Work (45 minutes)
1. **Archive Review** (15 ph√∫t): What did I capture this week?
2. **Connection Building** (20 ph√∫t): Link new concepts to existing knowledge
3. **Application Planning** (10 ph√∫t): Select concepts to actively use

### Monthly Optimization (60 minutes)
1. **System Audit** (20 ph√∫t): What's working, what's not?
2. **Pattern Analysis** (20 ph√∫t): What themes are emerging?
3. **Strategic Adjustment** (20 ph√∫t): Realign system v·ªõi goals

## MEASUREMENT & IMPROVEMENT

### Key Metrics
- **Capture Rate**: How much daily information gets processed?
- **Application Rate**: How often do you actually use captured knowledge?
- **Retrieval Success**: Can you find information when needed?
- **Connection Density**: How well-linked is your knowledge base?

### Success Indicators
- Faster decision-making in work situations
- Increased confidence in strategic discussions
- Better pattern recognition across domains
- Reduced "I know I read this somewhere" moments

## TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON ISSUES

**Problem**: "I capture too much, process too little"
**Solution**: Implement strict daily processing limit. Better to fully process 3 items than partially process 10.

**Problem**: "I can't find information when I need it"
**Solution**: Improve your tagging system. Use consistent vocabulary and create a "search shortcuts" document.

**Problem**: "Knowledge feels disconnected"
**Solution**: Monthly "connection sessions" - deliberately look for patterns across different domains.

**Problem**: "System feels like overhead"
**Solution**: Reduce complexity. Focus on just CAPTURE and APPLICATION for 2 weeks, then gradually add processing layers.
