## Writing Style - Brutally Honest

### Tone Characteristics
- **Direct**: No beating around the bush
- **Specific**: Concrete examples, not vague complaints
- **Fair**: Harsh but justified criticism
- **Constructive**: Point out what could be better
- **Authentic**: Personal experience focus

### Language Approach

**Instead of vague complaints, use specific examples:**

‚ùå "The food was not great"
‚úÖ "The pho broth lacked depth - tasted like instant soup mix with some herbs thrown in. For 150k, you can get authentic pho at [specific restaurant] that actually simmers bones for 12 hours."

‚ùå "Service could be improved"
‚úÖ "Waited 15 minutes just to get menu, server clearly didn't know ingredients when asked about allergies. When dish came wrong, took another 20 minutes to fix. Felt like eating at a cafeteria, not a restaurant charging premium prices."

‚ùå "Not worth the money"
‚úÖ "580k for 2 people to eat mediocre pasta and drink overpriced smoothies. Same money gets you excellent Italian at [specific place] or authentic Vietnamese feast for 4 people at [local spot]."

## Implementation Examples

### Sample Restaurant Review
```
THE REALITY: Instagram-worthy cafe charging fine dining prices for food court quality.

BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT: Skip it.
Price paid: 320k for 2 people | Time spent: 1.5 hours | Would return: Never

WHAT THEY PROMISE vs WHAT YOU GET
Promise: "Artisanal coffee and farm-to-table brunch"
Reality: Bitter espresso from commercial machine, eggs benedict with processed 
hollandaise that tasted like mayo mixed with lemon juice.

THE GOOD (barely any)
Nice interior design for photos. Clean bathroom.

THE DISAPPOINTING
- Avocado toast (180k): Two thin bread slices with half an avocado mashed on top, 
  no seasoning, served cold
- Coffee (65k): Burnt taste, clearly from beans sitting too long
- Service: Had to ask 3 times for water refill

THE DEALBREAKERS
Overheard kitchen microwaving the "fresh" quiche. For 320k total, got food that 
Highlands Coffee serves better at half the price.

VALUE ANALYSIS
320k here vs 160k at [specific local breakfast spot] for twice the food quality. 
Or same money gets you excellent brunch at [hotel name] with real service.

WHO SHOULD GO / WHO SHOULD SKIP
Skip: Anyone wanting good food or value
Maybe go: If you need Instagram photos and don't care about eating well

FINAL VERDICT: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ (2/5)
RECOMMENDATION: Skip completely
ALTERNATIVES: [Local spot] for value, [Hotel cafe] for quality experience
```

### Sample Hotel Review
```
THE REALITY: "Luxury boutique hotel" that's actually a renovated guesthouse with 
fancy lobby photos.

BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT: Overpriced disappointment.
Price paid: 1,200k/night | Time spent: 2 nights | Would return: No

WHAT THEY PROMISE vs WHAT YOU GET
Promise: "Luxury accommodation with premium amenities"
Reality: Thin walls, hard bed, shower with inconsistent water pressure, 
"premium" toiletries from wholesale supplier.

THE GOOD
Central location. Staff tried to be helpful when problems arose.

THE DISAPPOINTING
- Room smaller than photos suggest (classic wide-angle lens trick)
- Air conditioning couldn't keep up with heat, room stayed warm
- "Soundproof" windows let in all street noise until 2am
- Breakfast "buffet" was 6 dishes, half of them cold

THE DEALBREAKERS
Promised airport transfer never showed up. Had to pay taxi 400k extra.
When complained, got "sorry, sometimes our driver is busy" with no compensation.

VALUE ANALYSIS
1,200k/night here vs 800k at [established hotel chain] with consistent quality
and actual room service. Or 2,000k at [luxury hotel] for real luxury experience.

WHO SHOULD GO / WHO SHOULD SKIP
Skip: Anyone expecting actual luxury or value for money
Consider: If location is absolutely critical and other places booked out

FINAL VERDICT: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ (2/5)
RECOMMENDATION: Look elsewhere first
ALTERNATIVES: [Hotel chain] for reliability, [Luxury hotel] for real premium
```
